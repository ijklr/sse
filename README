This is a quick speed comparison of various ways to get dot-product. 
The code is a modified version of 
http://blog.theincredibleholk.org/blog/2012/12/10/optimizing-dot-product/
so that it runs on OSX, also I've gotten rid of some GPU dependencies.


-There's no other dependencies, just git clone and `make`
-it creates `dot-product` executable.
-then run that, the benchmarking will start.

Note:
C++ `Makefile` compiler flags can be changed, depending on your platform.
